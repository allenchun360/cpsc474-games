I discussed my solution with: TA.

DISCUSSION

Understanding how to implement the top down approach for dynamic programming was difficult at first. I initially had trouble trying to understand how to apply Professor Glenn's formulas for calculating expected values for player 2, but as I started to understand the mechanisms of top down programming, I saw how I could use the formula as the recursion part of my code. After implementing expected wins, I allowed my recursive function to take in a roll parameter and also return an optimal move based on that roll. Whenever --expect was called, I just passed in None for roll. I used the same logic for player 1, but with different base cases.
