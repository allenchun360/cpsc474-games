I discussed my solution with: Kishan Patel.

DISCUSSION

Understanding the starter code from the beginning was difficult
as there were many concepts and commands to implement. Once I understood the starter code, figuring out how to calculate probabilites for particular strategies using the linear programming function. Once I got find to work functionally, I then started working on verify where I had to check if the mixed strategy outputted by find was in equilibrium by comparing the mixed strategies to every combination of pure strategies. While implmenting both find and verify, I worked on tolerance to try passing more public test cases.
