DISCUSSION

Figuring out which data structure to store the updating q-values and the alpha values
took a while. I eventually decided to go with a dictionary that used bin values as keys and a dictionary of action keys and q-value/alpha values as the values (dictionary within a dictionary). Trying to get as close to Professor Glenn's outputs in the spec involved a lot of plugging and chugging values.
